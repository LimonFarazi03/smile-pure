                What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Authentication is the process of identifying users and
                validating who they claim to be. One of the most common and
                obvious factors to authenticate identity is a password. If the
                user name matches the password credential, it means the identity
                is valid, and the system grants access to the user.
                Authorization happens after a userâ€™s identity has been
                successfully authenticated. It is about offering full or partial
                access rights to resources like database, funds, and other
                critical information to get the job done.

                Why are you using firebase? What other options do you have to
                implement authentication?
              </h1>
              <p>
                I do use firebase for implementing authentication system in the
                application. Firebase is a service of google. Since,
                authentication means the transaction of very important data like
                email, phone, password, credit card info, so i chose google to
                handle these. There are so many alternatives of firebase to
                implement authentication. Some of them are Auth0, Passport,
                Okta, Keycloak etc.
